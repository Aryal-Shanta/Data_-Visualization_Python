ATmega328p are the AVR micro-controller. They provide high performance in the circuit operation. IT is 8-bit low power micro-controller. The RISC architecture embedded in it is advanced. It has 131 powerful instructions and the single clock executable cycle. It has 32*8 working register and also are fully static operational. The RISC architectures are up to 16MIPS having the 16MHz frequency. Also, it is made with 2 cycle on chip multiplier.  Some other features are the high endurance non-volatile memory segments that has 1 kilo bytes EEPROM, 2 kilo bytes internal SRAM. Further, it supports the in-system programming by on-chip boot program. There is software security offered by programming lock. Also, about the peripheral features there are two 8-bit timer/counters with comparable mode and separate prescaler. Also, real time counter with separate oscillator. There are six-PWM channels and 8-channel 10bit ADC in TQFP and QFN/MLF package. Programmable serial USART., master-slave SPI interface, on chip analog comparator etc. are the features of ATmega 328p microcontroller. Also, some of the special features are they have interrupt sources both external and internal, have the calibrated internal oscillator, reset on power-on and the brown -out detection program me etc.
